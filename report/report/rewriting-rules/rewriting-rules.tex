\chapter{Rewriting rules}
In this chapter we define a DSL for describing SML rewriting rules. We also give
a system of inference rules for carrying out the rewritings. We assume that
matches has already been rewritten to a normal form (see \fref{chap:normal-form})
before a rewriting rule is applied.

At this point we are only concerned with the rewriting of matches but our
implementation is geared towards handling expression rewriting as well (see
\fref{sec:rule-syntax} and \fref{sec:future-work}).

\paragraph{Note.} This chapter was written at a much later time than
\fref[plain]{chap:normal-form} which is why they differ so much in style.
