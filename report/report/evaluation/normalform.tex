\section{Normal form}
\label{sec:eval-normal-form}

The implemented \ttt{NormalForm} application heavily relies on the SML pretty
printer for printing the AST. Since the pretty printer has only been partly
implemented the \ttt{NormalForm} application is limited by this. The main
limitations of the pretty printer right now are data type declarations, signatures,
structures and functors. The biggest problem with this is that the application
can't normalise a function that uses data types. Actually the normalisation
procedure works just fine, but when the application tries to pretty print the
original and normalised code it throws an exception.

We give some examples of the output produced by the \ttt{NormalForm} application
including comments. More traces of the functions mentioned in
\fref{chap:concrete-examples} can bee seen in \fref{sec:trace-normalform}.
