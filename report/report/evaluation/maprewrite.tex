\section{Map rewriting}
\label{sec:eval-map-rewriting}

The implemented \ttt{RewriteMap} application normalises the function before
trying to rewrite it and therefore it has the same issues as the
\ttt{NormalForm} application described above in
\fref[plain]{sec:eval-normal-form}. Where the biggest issue is the pretty
printer not being fully implemented.


We give some examples of the output produced by the \ttt{RewriteMap} application
including comments. More traces of the functions mentioned in
\fref{chap:concrete-examples} can bee seen in
\fref{sec:trace-map-rewrite}.
