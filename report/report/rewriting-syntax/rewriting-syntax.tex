Patterns in SML can be thought of as trees with constructors as nodes and
variables as liefs where nullary constructors is not seen as liefs.

In the following chapter we will be generalising patterns to be parameterised
over their liefs, meaning that SML patterns are patterns over (SML) variables.

We follow the convention that constants can be thought of as being nullary
constructors\footnote{as in the ``Mini-ML'' document}. It is also assumed, for
all code we will match, that

\begin{enumerate}
\item All \texttt{as}-patterns has been removed (this can be done by
  substitution).

\item All infix functions has been turned into their nonfix counterparts.

\item ... Most likely something else \fixme{More to the list of stuff that is
    assumed of the code we will work on}
\end{enumerate}
