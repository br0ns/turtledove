\chapter{Concrete examples}
\label{chap:concrete-examples}
In this chapter we present rewriting rules for \ttt{map}, \ttt{foldl} and
\ttt{foldr} forms. We then show the rules in action on a body of example code.

We have chosen rules concerning list combinators since they turn up very
often. The \ttt{map} form was chosen for its simplicity whereas the
\ttt{fold$($l$|$r$)$} forms was chosen for their complexity; it is our
experience as teaching assistants that students often struggle with these forms.

Other forms concerning list combinators that turn up often are \ttt{exists} and
\ttt{all} forms. But we have not made rules for these.

\section{Examples}
Assignments and exams in the following are taken from the course ``Introduction
to Programming'' taught at the Department of Computer Science, University of
Copenhagen (DIKU).

When determining $\sigma$ and the $\theta$'s we do not distinguish sharply
between the two as the typesetting of the variables makes it clear what belongs
where.
