\chapter{Concrete Examples}
In this chapter we present rewriting rules for \ttt{map}, \ttt{foldl} and
\ttt{foldr} forms. We then show the rules in action on a body of example code.

We have chosen rules concerning list combinators since they turn up very
often. The \ttt{map} form was chosen for its simplicity whereas the
\ttt{fold$($l$|$r$)$} forms was chosen their complexity; it is our experience as
teaching assistants that students often struggle with these forms.

Other forms concerning list combinators that turn up often are \ttt{exists} and
\ttt{all} forms. But we have not made rules for these.
