\chapter{Conclusion}
We have written a substantial amount of code during this project. About 17500
lines to be specific. Much of this should be usable as a starting point for
other projects or of a good enough quality to continue developing.

We are especially happy with our library MyLib, SML parser and AST
representation. We have not seen an AST representation similar to ours before,
but we think that it works really well in practice.\\[1em]

\noindent
Unfortunately our software never got to the state where it is usable inside an
editor. We think that is a pity since we have already implemented some useful
tools and others would not take much additional work with the current code
base.

We believe just a few simple tools would make programming with SML a much more
enjoyable endeavour --- especially for newcomers.

As the rewriting rules are concerned we've had a hard time judging their
benefit, since we never got to the point where we could test many rules on large
amounts of code.

While we trust that function rewriting can be very useful, we also think that
rewriting of expressions is a good place to look for further
work. In particular simplification of boolean expressions seems to be hard for
new programmers.
