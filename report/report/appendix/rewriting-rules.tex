\chapter{Rewriting rules}
We defined rules for \ttt{map}, \ttt{foldr} and \ttt{foldl} forms in
\fref{chap:concrete-examples}. Here we give the rules as their ASCII
representation.

Note that we do not yet support the underscore-syntax for pattern variables.

\section{\textsf{map$_\textsf{a}$}}
\begin{verbatim}
Rule Clauses map_a
   | §C[_x :: xs] => £D §C[_x] :: self §C[xs]
   | §D => nil
where
   samedom (§D, §C)
becomes
   | §C[xs] => map (fn x => £D §C[x]) xs
end
\end{verbatim}

\section{\textsf{map$_\textsf{b}$}}
\begin{verbatim}
Rule Clauses map_b
   | §C[_x :: xs] => £D §C[_x] :: self §C[xs]
   | §C[x] => x
becomes
   | §C[xs] => map (fn x => £D §C[x]) xs
end
\end{verbatim}

\section{\textsf{foldr}}
\begin{verbatim}
Rule Clauses foldr
   | §C[_x :: xs] => £D (§C[_x], self §C[xs])
   | §D => £E §D
where
   samedom (§D, §C)
becomes
   | §C[xs] => foldr (fn (x, a) => £D (§C[x], a)) (£E §C[xs]) xs
end
\end{verbatim}

\newpage
\section{\textsf{foldl}}
\begin{verbatim}
Rule Clauses foldl
   | §C[_x :: xs][_a] => self §C[_x][£D §C[_x][_a]]
   | §C[_x][_a] => _a
becomes
   | §C[xs][a] => foldl (fn (x, a) => £D §C[x][a]) a xs
end
\end{verbatim}
