Normalizing
  (nil) x = x
  (f :: (nil)) x = f (x)
  (f :: fs) x = f (composelist fs x)
After elimination:
  (nil) x = x
  (f :: (nil)) x = f (x)
  (f :: fs) x = f (composelist fs x)
Generalising
  (nil) x = x
becomes
  y x = x
Now have
  y x = x

Generalising
  (f :: fs) x = f (composelist fs x)
becomes
  (f :: fs) x = f (composelist fs x)
Now have
  (f :: fs) x = f (composelist fs x)
  y x = x

Generalising
  (f :: (nil)) x = f (x)
becomes
  (f :: b) x = f (x)
Now have
  (f :: (nil)) x = f (x)
  (f :: fs) x = f (composelist fs x)
  y x = x

Normalizing

  (y :: ys) x = y (composelist (ys) x)
After elimination:

Generalising
  (nil) x = x
becomes
  y x = x
Now have

Generalising
  (y :: ys) x = y (composelist (ys) x)
becomes
  (y :: ys) x = y (composelist (ys) x)
Now have

Before:
fun composelist [] x = x
  | composelist (f :: []) x = f (x)
  | composelist (f :: fs) x = f (composelist fs x)
fun composelist [] x = x
  | composelist (y :: ys) x = y (composelist (ys) x)

After:
fun composelist (f :: (nil)) x = f (x)
  | composelist (f :: fs) x = f (composelist fs x)
  | composelist y x = x
fun composelist (y :: ys) x = y (composelist (ys) x)
  | composelist y x = x
