                x div 2 + sumlige xs
              else

After elimination:
  (nil) = 0
  (x :: xs) = if x mod 2 = 0 then
                x div 2 + sumlige xs
              else
                sumlige xs
Generalising
  (nil) = 0
becomes
  x = 0
Now have
  x = 0

Now have

  x = 0

Before:
fun sumlige [] = 0
  | sumlige (x :: xs) = if x mod 2 = 0 then
                          x div 2 + sumlige xs
                        else
                          sumlige xs

After:
fun sumlige (x :: xs) = if x mod 2 = 0 then
                          x div 2 + sumlige xs
                        else
                          sumlige xs
  | sumlige x = 0
