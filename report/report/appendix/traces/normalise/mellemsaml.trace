After elimination:

  (x :: xs) = x ^ " " ^ (mellemsaml xs)
Generalising
  (nil) = ""
becomes

Now have

Generalising

Generalising

Before:
fun mellemsaml [] = ""
  | mellemsaml [x] = x
  | mellemsaml (x :: xs) = x ^ " " ^ (mellemsaml xs)

After:
fun mellemsaml (x :: nil) = x
  | mellemsaml (x :: xs) = x ^ " " ^ (mellemsaml xs)
  | mellemsaml x = ""
