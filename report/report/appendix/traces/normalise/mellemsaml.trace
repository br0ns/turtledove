After elimination:
  (nil) = ""
  (x :: nil) = x
  (x :: xs) = x ^ " " ^ (mellemsaml xs)
Generalising
  (nil) = ""
becomes
  x = ""
Now have
  x = ""

Generalising
  (x :: xs) = x ^ " " ^ (mellemsaml xs)
becomes

Now have

  x = ""

Generalising
  (x :: nil) = x
becomes

Now have

Before:
fun mellemsaml [] = ""
  | mellemsaml [x] = x
  | mellemsaml (x :: xs) = x ^ " " ^ (mellemsaml xs)

After:
fun mellemsaml (x :: nil) = x
  | mellemsaml (x :: xs) = x ^ " " ^ (mellemsaml xs)
  | mellemsaml x = ""
