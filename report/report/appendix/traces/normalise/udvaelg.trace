Normalizing
  xs (nil) = (nil)
  xs (y :: ys) = List.nth (xs, y) :: udvaelg xs ys
After elimination:
  xs (nil) = (nil)
  xs (y :: ys) = List.nth (xs, y) :: udvaelg xs ys
Generalising
  xs (nil) = (nil)
becomes
  xs x = x
Now have
  xs x = x

Generalising
  xs (y :: ys) = List.nth (xs, y) :: udvaelg xs ys
becomes
  xs (y :: ys) = List.nth (xs, y) :: udvaelg xs ys
Now have
  xs (y :: ys) = List.nth (xs, y) :: udvaelg xs ys
  xs x = x

Before:
fun udvaelg xs [] = []
  | udvaelg xs (y :: ys) = List.nth (xs, y) :: udvaelg xs ys

After:
fun udvaelg xs (y :: ys) = List.nth (xs, y) :: udvaelg xs ys
  | udvaelg xs x = x
