Normalizing
  (f :: fs, v) = f v :: evallist (fs, v)
  ([], _) = []
After elimination:
  (f :: fs, v) = f v :: evallist (fs, v)
  ((nil), x) = (nil)
Generalising
  ((nil), x) = (nil)
becomes
  y = (nil)
Now have
  y = (nil)

Generalising
  (f :: fs, v) = f v :: evallist (fs, v)
becomes
  (f :: fs, v) = f v :: evallist (fs, v)
Now have
  (f :: fs, v) = f v :: evallist (fs, v)
  y = (nil)

Before:
fun evallist (f :: fs, v) = f v :: evallist (fs, v)
  | evallist ([], _) = []

After:
fun evallist (f :: fs, v) = f v :: evallist (fs, v)
  | evallist y = (nil)
