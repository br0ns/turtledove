  nil = nil
  (x :: xs) = x + 1 :: foo xs
After elimination:
  nil = nil
  (x :: xs) = x + 1 :: foo xs
Generalising
  nil = nil
becomes
  x = x
Now have
  x = x

Generalising
  (x :: xs) = x + 1 :: foo xs
becomes
  (x :: xs) = x + 1 :: foo xs
Now have
  (x :: xs) = x + 1 :: foo xs
  x = x

Before:
fun foo nil = nil
  | foo (x :: xs) = x + 1 :: foo xs

After:
fun foo (x :: xs) = x + 1 :: foo xs
  | foo x = x
