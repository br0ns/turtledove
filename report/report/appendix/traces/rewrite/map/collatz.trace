self -> collatz(id: 33780, is: Val)
Number of found contexts: 1

Original recursive call:
Exp_App
  1 Exp_Var collatz(id: 33780, is: Val)
  2 Exp_Var xs(id: 33782, is: Val)
Recursive call with xs inserted into the hole
of the context:
Exp_App
  1 Exp_Var collatz(id: 33780, is: Val)
  2 Exp_Var xs(id: 33782, is: Val)
Recursive call match original.

Before:
fun collatz [] = []
  | collatz (x :: xs) = (if x mod 2 = 0 then
                           x div 2
                         else
                           3 * x + 1) :: collatz xs

After:
fun collatz xs = map (fn x => (if x mod 2 = 0 then
                                 x div 2
                               else
                                 3 * x + 1)) xs
