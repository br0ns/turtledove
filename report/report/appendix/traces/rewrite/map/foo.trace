Normalising and rewriting: foo.sml
self -> foo(id: 34765, is: Val)
Number of found contexts: 1

Original recursive call:
Exp_App
  1 Exp_Var foo(id: 34765, is: Val)
  2 Exp_Var xs(id: 34767, is: Val)
Recursive call with xs inserted into the hole
of the context:
Exp_App
  1 Exp_Var foo(id: 34765, is: Val)
  2 Exp_Var xs(id: 34767, is: Val)
Recursive call match original.

Before:
fun foo nil = nil
  | foo (x :: xs) = x + 1 :: foo xs

After:
fun foo xs = map (fn x => x + 1) xs
