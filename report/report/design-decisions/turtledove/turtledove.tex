\label{sec:design-turtledove}

Turtledove is an all-in-one solution to ``Tool assisted programming in SML with
special emphasis on semi-automatic rewriting to predefined standard forms''. As

Turtledove is an aim at being the first a back end system that can easily be
integrated into most of the currently available development environments.


To facilitate this Turtledove is a modular system with a few key tools described
