\section{Turtledove}
\label{sec:design-turtledove}

Turtledove is an all-in-one solution to ``Tool assisted programming in SML with
special emphasis on semi-automatic rewriting to predefined standard forms''. As
of this writing no integrated development environment exists for SML that offers
high level assistance such as ``refactoring'' or ``go to definition''.
Turtledove is an aim at being a back end system that can easily be integrated
into most of the currently available development environments.

To facilitate this Turtledove should be a modular system with a few key tools
described below. At the core of turtledove are the parsers (SML, MLB and Rules),
which makes it possible for the tools to work on any user code.

Turtledove consists of two key components (see \fref{fig:turtledove-design}),
the project manager and the rewriting tool. The project manager is an important
part of Turtledove with respect to performance (together with the source
management module) but also to help the novice
programmer in building medium/large programs, whereas the rewriting tool is the
main purpose behind the creation of Turtledove in the first place. Both are
explained in detail below.

\paragraph{Threading.}

Threading is an easy way of executing the desired modular design idea of
Turtledove but also as a high throughput is needed by the development
environment. It is of no use if the user has to wait 10+ seconds for auto
completion or looking up the declaration point of a variable because Turtledove
was doing some arbitrary job that had nothing to do with the requested
information. Also it could happen that the user and the development environment
asked for some actions shortly after each other which would otherwise make one
of them wait.

All components within Turtledove including the tools is thus run in a thread for
itself and the communication bridge is used to bind all the threads together.
