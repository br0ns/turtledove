\subsection{Project manager}

When turtledove is to be used in collaboration with an editor and wants to take
advantage of all the features it has to offer, the project manager must be
used. The project manager is ultimately responsible for handling project files
which in the end will be converted into an MLB file.

The reason why project files aren't just MLB files is that they don't enforce
enough limitations in how they are written which would make it practically
impossible to write a descent tool to manipulate them whereas it makes it quite
easy for the user to hack something together.

Dependencies are properly the most challenging thing for a tool to handle as
these are most often done with a local

\begin{example}\ \\
Example of an MLB file including the basis and MyLib library in a local
  \begin{sml}
local
  $(SML_lIB)/basis/basis.mlb
  $(SML_LIB)/mylib/MyLib.mlb
in
Main.sml
end      
  \end{sml}
\end{example}
