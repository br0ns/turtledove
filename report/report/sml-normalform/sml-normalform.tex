\chapter{SML normalform}

In this chapter we will present the definition of a normalform for matches in a
language weary similar to SML and how to derive it from any well formed code in
this language. The language presented below is untyped for simplicity, but
obviously when the techniques are transfered to a language with types, the code
must not only be well formed but also type check.

In the end we will give an informal argument of how this can be directly
transfered to work on any well formed SML code that type check.
