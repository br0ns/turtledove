\section{Map}


\fixme{The missing notation of meta variables makes the xs in the matching seem
  exactly the same.}
\begin{verbatim}
Rule Clauses Map
   | §C[x :: xs] => :: (£D §C[x],  self §C[xs])
   | §D => nil
where
   dom (§D, §C)
becomes
   | §C[xs] => map (fn m => £D §C[m]) xs
end
\end{verbatim}


\section{Fold}

\begin{verbatim}
Rule Clauses foldr
   | §C[x :: xs] => £D (§C[x], self §C[xs])
   | §D => [E] §D
where
   dom (§D, §C)
becomes
   | §C[xs] => foldr (fn (a, b) => £D (§C[a], b)) (£E §C) xs
end
\end{verbatim}
