\section*{Mylib}

The idea behind this base library is to implement the most basic data structures
such as dictionaries, sets, trees and etc. 

\subsection*{Dictionarie}

\subsection*{Set}

\subsection*{Map}

\subsection*{Tree}

% In the design we can talk about the below mentioned two types.
% But in the implementation we just say that we have implemented the later.

There is a need for two different kind of trees.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ordinary trees, binary as n-ary

\item Trees with enhanced possibility of walking around the nodes by getting
  a list of the children or getting the parent node.

This will be a necessary feature when representing the syntax trees.
\end{enumerate}
