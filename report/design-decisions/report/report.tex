\section{Reporting}

Throughout the project we will need a way of logging or reporting data to the
user. This needs to be done in a way that is reasonable to the user so she can
get a clear overview of the message.

As this reporting feature will be used to both represent error messages and
general text messages it needs at least to implement basic pretty printing
features.

These basic features include the following

\begin{description}
\item[Word wrap] Wrap long lines to a predefined standard length of example 80
  characters per line.

\item[Indentation] Indent whole portions of text a predefined number of
  characters, while still being word wrapped.

\item[Lists] Listing elements with either a bullet or number.
\end{description}
