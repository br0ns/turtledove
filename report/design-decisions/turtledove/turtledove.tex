\subsection{Project manager}

The project manager is responsible for managing a project or a ``single
file''-project. 

A ordinary project is defined in a MLB file (ML Basis file \cite{mlbasis}) with the extension
.mlb. Each project file may contain references to other project files which will
be considered as a sub project.  

It is important to distinguish between the currently open project and its
containing sub projects. For example when adding a new file to the project,
should the file then be added to the currently open project or to one of the sub
project.


A ``single file''-project is when trying to open a stand alone file, normally a
.sml or .sig file, instead of a MLB file. As a stand alone file doesn't contain
any references to the standard library among other things it needs to be handled
specially before it can be compiled\footnote{because the environment for parsing
  is defined through the standard library.}and thus also parsed.

The ``single file''-projects are when a stand alone .sml file or .sig file is
opened.
