\section{Title}
``Programmer tools based on static semantic analysis of SML programs, with special emphasis on
semi-automatic rewriting of declarations to predefined forms.''

\section{Motivation}
Today functional programming languages are not very widespread outside academic circles. A reason
for this is that not many programmer assisting tools exist for functional programming languages
compared to certain imperative languages.

We wish to make functional programming, specifically in SML, easier to approach for the beginner as
well as more advantageous for the veteran. The means by which we hope to accomplish this task is the
development of a framework for implementing programmer assisting tools, and one or more actual
tools.

Functional programming languages has a wide variety of advantages that make them specially suited
for quick and correct statical analysis. The effect of this is that it will be possible to make more
complex tools for functional programming languages than for imperative ones.
