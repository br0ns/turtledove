@article{flask08,
	abstract = {Severely resource-constrained devices present a confounding
                  challenge to the functional programmer: we are used to having
                  powerful abstraction facilities at our fingertips, but how can
                  we make use of these tools on a device with an 8- or 16-bit
                  CPU and at most tens of kilobytes of RAM? Motivated by this
                  challenge, we have developed Flask, a domain specific language
                  embedded in Haskell that brings the power of functional
                  programming to sensor networks, collections of highly
                  resource-constrained devices. Flask consists of a staging
                  mechanism that cleanly separates node-level code from the
                  meta-language used to generate node-level code fragments;
                  syntactic support for embedding standard sensor network code;
                  a restricted subset of Haskell that runs on sensor networks
                  and constrains program space and time consumption; a
                  higher-level "data stream" combinator library for quickly
                  constructing sensor network programs; and an extensible
                  runtime that provides commonly-used services.},
